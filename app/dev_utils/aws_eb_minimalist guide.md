If your AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB) environment crashes immediately upon creation, it’s often due to misconfigurations in your application, dependencies, or the Elastic Beanstalk settings. Here’s a systematic approach to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:
1. Start with a Minimal Environment
	•	Create a Clean Elastic Beanstalk Environment:
	•	Use the default EB platform without uploading your application code.
	•	Test if the environment stays in a healthy state. If it does, the issue is likely with your application.
    - Set up ssh for future debugging
2. Check Logs Immediately
Even if the environment is failing, you can retrieve logs:
eb logs
	•	Look for errors in:
	•	eb-engine.log: Elastic Beanstalk configuration issues.
	•	web.stdout.log or web.stderr.log: Application errors.
	•	If the logs are unavailable via CLI, go to the EC2 console and retrieve logs directly from the instance.
3. Validate Application Code
	•	Run Locally: Test the application on your local machine to ensure it runs without issues.
	•	Ensure the Correct Port:
	•	Elastic Beanstalk expects the application to listen on port 8080 (default).
	•	Update your application code if it binds to a different port.
	•	Example in Python (FastAPI):
import uvicorn
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("app:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
	•	Check Dependencies:
	•	Ensure all required dependencies are listed in requirements.txt or package.json (depending on your stack).
4. Verify Elastic Beanstalk Configuration
	•	Application Platform:
	•	Confirm you’ve selected the correct platform (e.g.,Python, Docker).
	•	Environment Variables:
	•	If your application depends on environment variables, ensure they are properly configured in Elastic Beanstalk under Configuration > Software.
	•	Instance Type:
5. Test Without Application Code
	•	Deploy the Default Sample Application:
	•	Run:
eb create --sample
	•	If this works, the issue is likely with your application code or deployment package.
6. Use a Custom Health Check Path
	•	By default, Elastic Beanstalk uses / for health checks. If your application doesn’t handle root-level requests, the environment will be marked as unhealthy.
	•	Add a health check endpoint to your application (e.g., /health).
	•	Update the health check path in Elastic Beanstalk under Configuration > Load Balancer > Health Check Path.
7. Debug Directly on the Instance
	•	If the environment keeps crashing, SSH into the instance before it terminates:
eb ssh
	•	Check logs and running processes:
	•	Web server logs:
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
	•	Application logs:
sudo tail -f /var/log/web.stdout.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/web.stderr.log
8. Congfigure HTTP to HTTPS redirect in AWS eb configuration console
9. Use Elastic Beanstalk Managed Logs
Enable Elastic Beanstalk log streaming to CloudWatch:
	1.	Go to the Elastic Beanstalk Console > Configuration > Monitoring.
	2.	Enable log streaming to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
	3.	Check CloudWatch for logs to debug the issue.
Let me know what errors you find in the logs or if you need help with specific configurations!
