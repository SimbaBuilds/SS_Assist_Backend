	1a.Troubleshoot this environment first by checking logs and verifying the service is actually up on port 8000
	1b.	SSH Key or User Data: If you added SSH after creating the environment, the new instance might be stuck or failing to apply user-data properly.
	2.	Gunicorn/App Crash: The instance may not be running the app at all. Check logs under /var/log/web.stdout.log or /var/log/eb-engine.log to confirm Gunicorn/uvicorn is actually starting.
	3.	Security Group/Port: Ensure your ALB target group can reach port 8000 and that the instance SG isnâ€™t blocking.
	4.	Redirect Process Health: You have a separate redirect process on port 80. If it fails its health checks or never signals, it can degrade the entire environment. You can remove or relax health checks on the redirect process if it only serves 301/302.
