# Deploying FastAPI to AWS Elastic Beanstalk: A Comprehensive Guide


## Prerequisites


### 1. Install Required Tools
First, you'll need to install the AWS CLI and Elastic Beanstalk CLI:
```bash
pip install awscli
pip install awsebcli
```


### 2. Configure AWS Credentials
Set up your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:
```bash
aws configure
# You'll need to enter:
# - AWS Access Key ID
# - AWS Secret Access Key
# - Default region (e.g., us-east-1)
# - Default output format (json)
```


## Project Setup


### 1. Create Dockerfile
Create a new file named `Dockerfile` in your project root:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim


WORKDIR /app


COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt


COPY . .


EXPOSE 8000


CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```


### 2. Create .dockerignore
Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:
```
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
env/
venv/
.env
*.git
```


### 3. Create .ebignore
Create a `.ebignore` file with the same contents as your `.dockerignore`.


### 4. Configure Elastic Beanstalk
Create a directory named `.ebextensions` and add a file named `01_environment.config`:
```yaml
option_settings:
 aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
   WSGIPath: app.main:app
 aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy:staticfiles:
   /static: static
```


## Deployment Process


### 1. Initialize Elastic Beanstalk
```bash
eb init -p docker your-application-name
# Follow the prompts to select your region and create a new application
```


### 2. Create Environment
```bash
eb create your-environment-name
```


### 3. Deploy Application
```bash
eb deploy
```


### 4. Open Application
```bash
eb open
```


## Monitoring and Management


### Check Deployment Status
```bash
eb status
```


### View Logs
```bash
eb logs
```


### SSH Access
```bash
eb ssh
```


## Additional Configuration


### 1. Environment Variables
Update your FastAPI application to use environment variables:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import os


app = FastAPI()


port = int(os.getenv("PORT", 8000))
```


Set environment variables in Elastic Beanstalk:
```bash
eb setenv MY_VAR=value
```


### 2. Resource Configuration
Create `.ebextensions/02_resources.config` for custom AWS resource settings:
```yaml
option_settings:
 aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration:
   InstanceType: t2.micro
 aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:
   EnvironmentType: SingleInstance
```


### 3. CORS Configuration
Ensure proper CORS middleware configuration:
```python
app.add_middleware(
   CORSMiddleware,
   allow_origins=["*"],
   allow_credentials=True,
   allow_methods=["*"],
   allow_headers=["*"],
)
```


## Troubleshooting


### Common Issues and Solutions


1. **Health Check Failures**
  - Verify your application is listening on port 8000
  - Ensure it's accepting connections from `0.0.0.0`
  - Check the application logs using `eb logs`


2. **Deployment Failures**
  - Verify your Dockerfile is correct
  - Ensure all required files are not in .ebignore
  - Check instance capacity in your AWS region


3. **Performance Issues**
  - Monitor CPU and memory usage in AWS Console
  - Consider upgrading instance type
  - Review application logs for bottlenecks


## Cleanup


To avoid unnecessary AWS charges:


1. Terminate your environment:
```bash
eb terminate your-environment-name
```


2. Verify in AWS Console that all resources are properly terminated


## Best Practices


1. **Security**
  - Use environment variables for sensitive information
  - Regularly update dependencies
  - Implement proper authentication/authorization


2. **Monitoring**
  - Set up AWS CloudWatch alerts
  - Monitor application metrics
  - Regularly check logs


3. **Cost Management**
  - Use appropriate instance types
  - Set up billing alerts
  - Regular cleanup of unused resources
